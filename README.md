# Real-Time-Chat
The Basic requirement for the Chat-App is sending and reciveing of messeges without reloading the page.But using http/https request the server closed once the request is completed due to which we have to reload the page again and again.

To overcome this we use socket.io as once it started it won't get close until and unless the user left.

To start the application run both the file on node.js using command - 
# npm init

you are welcome by the page asking username and ChatRoom you want to enter and chat. Make sure the person you want to chat with type the same room as you did.

Hope you like it!! Enjoy Chatting :-)
